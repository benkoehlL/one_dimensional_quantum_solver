# One-dimensional quantum solver
A project where a one-dimensional quantum system is
evolved through time by solving the time-dependent
Schrödinger equation for a given discretization
of the potential and the wave function using either
the Visscher [1] or a RK4 integration method.

    Schrödinger equation", Computers in  Physics 5 (6), 596-598 (1991)
## creating the environment/installing all necessary packages
In order to be able to use the library, run

`$ conda env create -f one-d_quantum_slver.yml`

in a terminal.
